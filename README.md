In recent years, the use of Deep Learning has achieved remarkable and great results in various fields, particularly in the domain of English character recognition, whether in written or printed form. This is because English is widely spoken as a first or second language by a significant portion of the world's population. Therefore, Arab researchers have turned to applying the advancements in modern English language processing and similar languages like French to the Arabic language and its equivalents, such as Urdu and Pashto, in order to keep up with global changes. Dealing with the Arabic language and its similar languages like Urdu and Pashto using machine learning and deep learning techniques presents challenges that researchers are trying to overcome to obtain satisfactory and comparable results to those achieved in the English language. Therefore, in this research, the most popular methods, techniques, and technologies in deep learning, such as CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, and Bi-GRU, were applied and tested on three Arabic language datasets: AHCD, Hijja, and AHDD. Subsequently, a comparison was made between the results obtained from these different techniques using performance measurement methods such as Precision, Recall, and Accuracy.
