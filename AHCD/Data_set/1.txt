Handwritten Arabic character recognition systems face several challenges, including the unlimited variation in human handwriting and large public databases. In this work, we model a deep learning architecture that can be effectively apply to recognizing Arabic handwritten characters. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special type of feed-forward multilayer trained in supervised mode. The CNN trained and tested our database that contain 16800 of handwritten Arabic characters. In this paper, the optimization methods implemented to increase the performance of CNN. Common machine learning methods usually apply a combination of feature extractor and trainable classifier. The use of CNN leads to significant improvements across different machine-learning classification algorithms. Our proposed CNN is giving an average 5.1% misclassification error on testing data.

The data set is composed of 16,800 characters written by 60 participants; the age range is between 19 and 40 years; and 90% of participants are right-hand. Each participant wrote each character (from ’alef’ to ’yeh’) ten times on two forms, as shown in Fig. 7(a) & 7(b). The forms were scanned at a resolution of 300 dpi. Each block is segmented automatically using Matlab 2016a to determine the coordinates for each block. The database is partitioned into two sets: a training set (13,440 characters to 480 images per class) and a test set (3,360 characters to 120 images per class). The writers of the training set and test set are exclusive. The ordering of including writers in to test set is randomized to make sure that writers of the test set are not from a single institution (to ensure the variability of the test set).

In an experimental section, we showed that the results were promising with a 94.9% classification accuracy rate on testing images. In future work, we plan to work on improving the performance of handwritten Arabic character recognition.
